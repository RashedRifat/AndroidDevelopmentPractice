# Android Development Practice

This is a refrence repository dedicated to projects and experiments related to Android App Development. Each project folder within this repo contains a working Android App with barebone features, usually testing a single aspect of Android Studio. **This repo roughly follows the CodeLab notebooks associated with Google's Associate Android Developer course.** 

A list of project descriptions is featured below. Some signiicant projects ar bolded to demonstrate mastery of several concepts or a capstone project for that unit. 

Feel free to take a look around and see some of my old projects. However, for fully developed projects, please take a look at the other standalone repositories dedicated to solely a single app. 

*How To Run These Files:* To run any of these apps, clone the repository and use Android Studio to open the project. Run it from there and an emulator should appear on your screen with the app running.
